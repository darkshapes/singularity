![An screenshot of a sophisticated node graph workflow and its result, a shoulder-height portrait of a pale and stoic android woman with far-eastern features depicted in a cyberpunk style.

A futuristic user interface is projected over half of the composition. ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e79bd1d-7dfa-4931-bcb9-4386b6d0128c)
